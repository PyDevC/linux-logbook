# About LiLog

Linux Logbook (LiLog) is a wiki for Linux. After reading through this wiki we expect you to be able to not just manually install Arch Linux but also other Linux Distributions.

But I Doesn't just end with the installation, its about application, maintenance, ricing, hardware, opinions on using the Linux with care. I try to mention everything wherever I can. I embrace the fact that if someone finds it difficult to understand the wiki, they will try to correct it or at least link us back to the reference where they resolved or understood the issue.

*Disclaimer*: The language in some files might sound like Arch Wiki, as it played a huge role in constructing this logbook.
